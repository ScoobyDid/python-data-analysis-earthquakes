This Python code analyzes earthquake data from the "Significant Earthquakes 1965-2016" database. It cleans the data, categorizes earthquake depths, reshapes the data using stacking and melting techniques, and constructs four different types of charts (line, bar, scatter, and histogram). Additionally, it utilizes the resample() function to analyze the data over time.
